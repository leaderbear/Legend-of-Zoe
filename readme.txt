Legend of Zoe is a school project. 


# Start the game 
----------------
To play it, you have to compile and run LegendOfZoe.java with any IDE. 
I used IntelliJ IDEA.

How to game works? When you see "appuyez sur n'importe quelle touche". 
Write anything into the console and press enter. The game will start.


# Control your player 
---------------------
You control Zoe (&) with "w" "a" "s" "d" 
Indeed, every time you want to move Zoe, you write the wanted char into 
the console and press enter . w -> up | s -> down | a -> left | d -> right
Ps : you can write more than one char at the time. For exemple, writing
"wwdd" will make Zoe move two time up and two time right. 



# How to play 
--------------
In the game you will see enemies (@) that will attack you and lower your hp
if you are out of hp , the game end and you have to run it again. So avoid @'s

To pass into the next level , you have to go to the Exit (E). But before that
you have to collect ($).  Have fun!
